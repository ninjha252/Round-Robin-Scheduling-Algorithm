            <h2>What is Round Robin Scheduling?</h2>
            <p>Round Robin (RR) scheduling is a CPU scheduling algorithm used by operating systems to manage the execution of multiple processes. It assigns a fixed time unit, known as a quantum, to each process in the queue. The CPU executes each process for a time frame equal to the quantum. If a process doesn't complete within this time, it's placed at the back of the queue and the next process is executed.</p>
            <p>This method offers a good balance between throughput and response time, providing all processes with an equal share of the CPU. It is particularly effective in time-sharing systems where it's important to give users the impression of simultaneous execution.</p>

            <h2>Understanding the Code</h2>
            <p>The provided C++ code implements a simple simulation of the Round Robin scheduling algorithm. It creates a series of process objects, each with an arrival time, burst time, and several other properties. It then calculates the waiting time and turnaround time for each process given a specified time quantum.</p>
            <p>Key components of the code include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Process Class:</strong> Defines the attributes of a process like ID, arrival time, burst time, and times for remaining, completion, waiting, and turnaround.</li>
                <li><strong>findWaitingAndTurnaroundTime Function:</strong> This function simulates the scheduling algorithm. It uses a queue to keep track of processes, cycling through them according to their arrival times and the given quantum. Processes are executed in intervals of the quantum or until completion.</li>
                <li><strong>Time Quantum:</strong> A defined time slice (quantum) that determines how long each process is executed in a single turn.</li>
                <li><strong>Main Function:</strong> Initiates the processes and invokes the function to simulate the scheduling, outputting the results for each process.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>At the end of the simulation, the code outputs the waiting time and turnaround time for each process, demonstrating the effect of the Round Robin scheduling algorithm on process completion.</p>
